       record provides a pointer to the base of the object with which the pointer(s) being

       derived pointers since a pointer may be outside the bounds of the original
       allocation, but still needs to be relocated with the allocation."

       "The Locations within each record may [be] a multiple of pointer size. In the later

       corresponding base pointers. If the Location is of size N x sizeof(pointer), then
       there will be N records of one pointer each contained within the Location. Both
       Locations in a pair can be assumed to be of the same size."
